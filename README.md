# Noah-Fighter
This repository showcases my applied programming projects across sports analytics, probability modeling, and algorithmic simulation.
Each project demonstrates my ability to design data-driven logic, optimize for performance, and build adaptable tools for real-world decision making.

Languages: C, Java, Python

Core Skills: algorithm design, data modeling, OOP, simulation logic, weighted projection systems

Concepts: probability modeling, sports data analysis, input validation, modular design

I’m a Computer Science student at Skidmore College (Class of 2027) with a strong interest in sports analytics, software engineering, and data modeling.
I love building systems that merge statistical insight with elegant technical design.
